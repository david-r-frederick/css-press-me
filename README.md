<h1>CSS Press Me</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>This project aims to enhance understanding of CSS by providing an interactive playground for various CSS properties. It's geared towards those who are still learning CSS and allows them to test certain concepts/limitations without needing to actually write code.</p>
<p>In addition to the interactive components, each CSS key available also has some basic information provided (optionallity viewable). This includes a basic definition, the MDN Link, and possibly unexpected behaviors/attributes (e.g. A percentage assigned to margin-top will be relative to the parent width, not the height). If anyone sees any errors or thinks of something that should be added, feel free to make a PR here and/or email me at dfrederick79@gmail.com.</p>
<h2>Subsets</h2>
<p>The subsets available to study and test are below. I'm gladly accepting any new ideas/criticisms for the architecture. I believe the controls for each are fairly intuitive, but I'll be glad to add a short tutorial here if I find that people are having trouble.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Flexbox</li>
  <li>Visibility</li>
  <li>Transition</li>
  <li>Animation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Under the Hood</h2>
<p>This website was bootstrapped with Create-React-App and uses React SizeMe, React-Draggable, and React Transition Group for most of the functionality and animations. A huge thanks to the makers and contributors of those technologies. It also makes use of Redux (React-Redux) for the tips and CSS modules.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>I am still maintaining this project and intend to add a lot more functionality, particularly to the animation page (transforms, for example).</p>
